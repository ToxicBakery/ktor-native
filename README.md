# Ktor Native
Just looking at Ktor Native on Linux to quick test performance for startup, memory, and response time of a simple 
hello world implementation.

Build all artifacts for your system, mac or linux.
```bash
./gradlew build
```

Release artifact can be run with:
```bash
./build/bin/native/releaseExecutable/ktor-native.kexe
```
